# DMD-and-CS-for-object-detection

This repo contains my investigations into how Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Compressed Sesning can be applied to video object detection.

The `matlab` folder contains code and examples taken from the Dynamic Mode Decomposition book by Kutz et al, implemented in MATLAB.
